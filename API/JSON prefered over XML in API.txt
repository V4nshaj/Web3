JSON is often preferred over XML for APIs due to its lightweight and straightforward syntax. JSON's concise structure leads to smaller payload sizes, reducing bandwidth usage and speeding up data transmission, which is crucial for web and mobile applications operating under limited network resources. Moreover, JSON's simplicity facilitates faster parsing, especially in JavaScript environments where JSON parsing is natively supported, resulting in improved performance and reduced processing overhead. Since JSON aligns well with the principles of Representational State Transfer (REST), it is commonly used for data exchange in RESTful APIs, offering simplicity, flexibility, and compatibility with HTTP methods. Additionally, JSON's widespread adoption in modern web development has resulted in extensive support from frameworks, libraries, and developer communities, making it the preferred choice for many API implementations. Its seamless integration with JavaScript further enhances its appeal, eliminating the need for additional parsing or conversion steps in JavaScript applications. While XML still has its use cases, such as compatibility with legacy systems or support for complex document structures, JSON's efficiency, simplicity, and popularity make it the go-to option for API development in contemporary web development practices.
