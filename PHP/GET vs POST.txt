In PHP, both GET and POST are methods used to send data to a server. Here's a breakdown of their differences:

GET Method:
Parameters are passed through the URL.
Limited amount of data can be sent, typically up to 2048 characters.
Data is visible in the URL, which can pose security risks, especially when sensitive information like passwords is involved.
GET requests can be bookmarked and cached.
It's suitable for requests where data is not sensitive and the amount of data to be sent is small, like fetching data from a server

POST Method:
Parameters are sent in the HTTP request body, not visible in the URL.
Larger amount of data can be sent compared to GET.
Data is not visible in the URL, providing better security.
POST requests are not cached, and therefore can't be bookmarked.
It's suitable for requests where sensitive data needs to be sent, like submitting forms with passwords or credit card details.

In summary, use GET when you're retrieving data from the server, and use POST when you're sending sensitive information or large amounts of data to the server.
